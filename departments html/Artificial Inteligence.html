                Artificial intelligence: It is a branch of computer science. Much of the literature defines artificial intelligence, as: “the study and design of intelligent customers.”
                 An intelligent customer is a system that understands its environment and takes positions that increase its chance of success in achieving its mission or team mission.

                This definition, in terms of goals, actions, perception, and environment is due to Russell & Norvig (2003) and other definitions also include knowledge and learning as additional criteria. 
                Computer scientist John McCarthy originally coined the term in 1956, defining himself as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".
                 Andreas Kaplan and Michael Heinlein define artificial intelligence as “the ability of a system to correctly interpret external data,
                 learn from that data, and use that knowledge to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation.”

                Narrow AI
     It is artificial intelligence that specializes in one field, for example, there are artificial intelligence systems that can beat the world champion in the game of chess, which is the only thing they do.

         artificial general intelligence
       This type refers to computers with the level of human intelligence in all fields, that is, it can perform any intellectual task that a person can perform, creating this type of intelligence is much more difficult than the previous type and we have not reached this level yet.

             Super Artificial Intelligence
       Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as “thought far smarter than the best human minds in nearly every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills,” and because of this type the field of artificial intelligence is an interesting area to delve into.
