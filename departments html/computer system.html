        <p>1- Software design and implementation: Other aspects of software development fall under this field, such as developing web pages, designing software interfaces, and software related to security aspects, as well as mobile computer science.
            It can be said that this path is the one chosen by most computer science graduates, and the professional opportunities for this path vary widely to include multiple environments, including software companies, whether small or large, computer service companies as well as large institutions of all kinds (whether they are industrial, governmental, banking, health. ..etc)
            </p>
        <p>2- Inventing new ways to use the computer: This field aims to invent new applications for computer technology. 
            The development of the field of computer science for networks, databases and user interfaces led to the development of the World Wide Web.
             Researchers are still working now in the field of computer science and in cooperation with scientists from other fields to make robotic aids more intelligent and realistic, 
            as well as using databases to create new cognitive systems, and using computers to help decipher the secrets of human DNA.
        </p>
        <p>
            3- Developing more effective methods for solving computer problems: This field includes the development or application of computer science theories and knowledge of algorithms to reach the best possible solutions to difficult computer problems.
             Where specialists in this field are developing effective ways to solve computer problems, 
            for example, computer scientists develop the best possible ways to store information in databases, send data over networks or display complex images on a computer.
            There is a fourth career path that attracts computer science graduates, although this field is not targeted by computer science programs. This career path is the planning and management of technical infrastructure,
             which is mainly within the interests of information technology programs.
