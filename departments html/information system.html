        <p>An information system is a system that consists of people, data records, and manual and non-manual operations. 
            This system processes data and information in any system. Or it is a group of overlapping elements that work together to collect, process,
             store and distribute the available information on a topic in a systematic way to support decision-making and to support organization, 
            control and analysis in the organization and build a clear current and future perception of the subject of research.

            Today, information and information technology has become one of the five resources available to managers to form an organization along with human resources,
             financial resources, raw materials, and machinery. There are many companies that have created the position of Chief Information Officer (CIO), which parallels several other positions, such as Chief Executive Officer (CEO),
              Head of Finance (CFO), 
            Head of Operations Department (COO) and Head of Technology Department (CTO).

            Information systems science arose as a branch of computer science, as an attempt to understand and manage technology within organizations. 
            Then it crystallized into a major field in management, as it was increasingly asserted that it is an important field of research in management studies,
             and it is taught in all the major universities and business schools in the world.
